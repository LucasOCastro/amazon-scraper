# Amazon Scraper
A web application to scrape the first page of a seach in the Amazon web store and display basic info about products, such as title, image, price and reviews.

### How to run
First, to host the backend, initiate a terminal inside the folder `backend`. Input the command `node ./src/index.js` and wait for the confirmation message in the terminal. The port is 8080, so make sure it is free!

Now you can open the file `frontend/index.html` in a web browser. Type one or more keywords into the input field and press the **Search** button. Wait for it to load and the results will be displayed.
